For my final summer of 2013 Co-op work term I rounded out my co-op experiences with a more academic focused Under Graduate Student Research Award (URSA) position. I was really glad that I was able to get this opportunity as in my previous positions I was able to get an experience of a large more corporate company, an individual project position (sort of like contract work), and a medium sized company with more of a start-up culture, but was lacking an academic experience.

This was important to me as from my previous positions I had been able to not only improve my various workplace skills, but also get an idea of what kind of workplaces suited me best, the kind of environment I was most productive in, and whether or not I enjoyed the work. As such coming into this final work term I new that I performed well in a fun casual office environment and that solo self motivated and self supervised work was not exactly my strong suit. What I did not know though, was how I would perform in a more academic or research environment. Furthermore this lack of experience was proving to be a critical issue for me in determining my post undergraduate plans, and whether I wanted to attempt graduate school.

Now at this point if you are familiar with work in an academic setting, and have noted my previous statement of weakness in self motivation and independent work, you may have a pretty good guess as to whats to come in the rest of this report. That said I'll try and keep the remainder of it interesting, if brief.
