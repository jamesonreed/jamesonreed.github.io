Overall I am really glad that I was able to have this opportunity. Even though it meant not staying on for 4 more summer months at FreshBooks, and taking a noticeable pay cut, the experience I gained and the lessons I learned I consider to invaluable. At the moment I don't feel that I have been able to overcome my weakness in organization and self motivation where independent work is concerned, and I have decided that immediately pursuing graduate school after graduation is probably not the right choice for me. I simply don't feel that I perform as well in the academic environment as I have in a office setting.

I did enjoy being exposed to higher level material, and would like the opportunity to work more with technologies at that level. However the structured and formal style of research is not something I can motivate myself with. I intend to use and build upon the knowledge I have gained working with and learning about exciting new technologies on my own time and my own projects, without the overhead.

Having come to the end of my co-op career, I have to take a moment and reflect on the experience as a whole, and say that it was great! Coming out of school I will be able to list experience with 4 great employers on my resume, and have a much better idea of the type of environment I want to work in, and the type of company I for whom I want to work. I have made great connections, and secured a few job leads, and couldn't be more excited for graduation this spring.

Thanks for reading,
