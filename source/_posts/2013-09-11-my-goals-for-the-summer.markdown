As previously mentioned in my intro to the position, my number one motivation for taking the position, and my primary goal for the summer, was to get an idea of how I performed in, and enjoyed (or not) the academic/research environment. Progress towards this goal however is not easily measured or tracked, and having successfully gotten the position, it's not something I can really aim for. As such I created a few more concrete goals for myself.

##1 Improve my academic writing skills.
A core responsibility in my URSA position was contributing to a conference paper my professor was working on. However aside from overly formal design documents for some software engineering courses the last academic paper I had written was for a first year Geography course, and needless to say, my skills were a little rusty.

##2 Improve my reading comprehension skills.
In order to understand and contribute to my professors research work I was required to read quite a few journal and conference papers pertaining to the subject. At the start this was time consuming and trying work, however as the work term progressed, I was able to determine the relevant portions of papers that I was concerned with and understand the key concepts at a much greater rate.

##3 Be productive and efficient in a self managed environment.
The most ambitious of my goals so far, knowing that I have previously struggled to excel when in a self motivated independent working environment, in comparison to my office job positions, I wanted to see if I could find a work flow or organizational methodology that would work for me. Unfortunately this was also the goal that I made the least successful progress on. I tried various methods and plans I thought might help but in the end performed best during the times when meetings and or feedback were plentifully available.
